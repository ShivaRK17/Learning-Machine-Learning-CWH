# K nearest neighbours means draw circles around a point 
# First k (eg.3 (this is very small but there will be more dimensions)) times, after spotting 3 nearest neighbours 
# IF there are more of (say spam-nonspam example), more spam out of total , that point is of spam
# Likewise we use KNN to classify a point 
# Its data structure is graph

# Pros and cons
# We have to predict where the point is is a con
# We find value of k using different types and choose the maximum accuracy one
# Testing phase need more computation

# Pros are It is very small/simple

# Distance can be Euclidean/Manhattan etc
